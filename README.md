New Features
A significant update has been made to this project as outlined below:

Screen Clear Confirmation: I have added a confirmation dialog that appears when the user presses the "C" button to clear the display. If the display is not empty, a prompt asking "Are you sure?" appears. If the user clicks "Yes", the display is cleared. If the user clicks "No", the display remains unchanged, and the user can continue. If the display is already empty, pressing the "C" button does not trigger any prompt.
This feature was added to enhance user experience and reduce the risk of accidentally clearing the display. It was implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
